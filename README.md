# LOAN_APPROVAL_PREDICTION
This repo contains the Loan Approval Prediction project as part of my data science portfolio. The loan approval prediction model was built using logistic regression to classify whether a loan application would be approved or rejected based on key applicant features such as education status, income, employment status, and loan amount. After hyperparameter tuning, the model's performance improved, with the accuracy increasing from 92% to 94%. I got the data from Kaggel.

 PROBLEM STATEMENT
 
Loan approval is vital in the financial sector, determining applicants' eligibility for credit based on financial profiles. This process impacts individuals’ access to funds for essential needs and affects lenders’ profitability and risk. It involves assessing factors like credit scores, income, and employment to grant loans responsibly, minimizing default risk. However, the process can be time-consuming and inconsistent, impacting efficiency and fairness in lending.A comprehensive evaluation process ensures that loans are granted responsibly to applicants who are most likely to repay, reducing the risk of default.

This is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. Specifically, it is a binary classification problem where we have to predict either one of the two classes given i.e. approved or not approved

EXPECTED OUTCOME

The expected outcome of this loan approval prediction project is a robust, data-driven model capable of accurately predicting loan approval status based on applicants' financial and personal information, such as credit scores, income levels, employment status, and asset values. This model will help streamline the approval process, improve consistency in decision-making, and enhance fairness by reducing potential biases. Additionally, the analysis will offer insights into key factors influencing loan approval, enabling lending institutions to make informed, risk-aware decisions that support both applicant needs and organizational goals.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this loan approval prediction project is to develop a reliable predictive model that identifies the likelihood of loan approval based on applicants' financial and demographic characteristics.

1. Improve Decision-Making Efficiency: Reduce the time and resources required for manual loan assessment.
2. Enhance Consistency and Fairness: Provide a standardized approach to loan approval, minimizing human bias.
3. Identify Key Predictive Factors: Offer insights into the most influential attributes in loan approval, helping to guide lending policies and strategies.
4. Mitigate Default Risk: Enable responsible lending by approving loans for applicants with a high probability of repayment, reducing the institution's risk exposure.

BUSINESS IMPLICATION

The model can serve as a valuable tool for financial institutions to streamline the loan approval process. With high recall, the model ensures that most eligible applicants are not rejected, while precision remains high enough to minimize the approval of unqualified applicants.

By understanding the factors that influence approval decisions, institutions can adjust their criteria or provide tailored advice to applicants, improving the overall quality of loan portfolios.
